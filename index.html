    <h3>Our University</h3>
    <p>Harvard University, founded in 1636, <br>
       is the oldest institution of higher education in the United <br>
        States and one of the most prestigious universities worldwide. <br>
         Located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard has a rich history <br>
          that spans nearly four centuries. The university’s mission is to educate <br>
           leaders who make a difference globally through teaching, research, and public <br>
            service. Harvard is composed of multiple schools including Harvard <br>
             College (undergraduate), Harvard Business School, Harvard Law School, Harvard Medical School, and several others, each specializing in different academic disciplines.
<br>
      The campus itself is a blend of historic and modern architecture, <br>
       featuring state-of-the-art facilities, extensive libraries, and museums. Harvard’s endowment, <br>
    one of the largest in the world, allows the university to provide generous financial aid packages, support groundbreaking research, and maintain a global network of alumni who are influential leaders, innovators, and public figures.

       and over 100 countries around the world. Students come from various cultural, <br>
        economic, and academic backgrounds, creating a vibrant and inclusive community. <br>
         The university is highly selective, with an acceptance rate often below 5%, <br>
          admitting only the top students who demonstrate outstanding academic achievements,<br>
           leadership qualities, and a passion for making a positive impact.
<br>

    <h3>Admissions</h3>
    <p>The admissions process at Harvard is extremely competitive and holistic. <br>
       Applicants are evaluated not only on their academic records, such as GPA <br>
        and standardized test scores like the SAT or ACT, but also on their extracurricular <br>
         involvement, leadership roles, personal essays, and letters of recommendation. <br>
          Harvard seeks students who show intellectual curiosity, creativity, resilience, and a commitment to community service.
<br>
      The university uses a need-blind admissions policy for domestic applicants, <br>
       meaning the ability to pay tuition does not affect the admission decision. <br>
        Once admitted, Harvard provides financial aid based on demonstrated need, <br>
         ensuring that all students can afford to attend regardless of their economic <br>
          background. This approach helps create a socioeconomically diverse student body. <br>
           The admissions office also conducts interviews to better understand the applicant’s personality, ambitions, and fit for the Harvard community.</p>
